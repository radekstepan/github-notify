## Quickstart

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install g++ zlib1g zlib1g-dev autoconf
$ npm install github-notify
```

Edit the `config.json` file:

##### timeout
How often to check for new issues (in minutes).

##### github.user
A GitHub username or organisation name.

##### github.repo
A GitHub repository.

##### github.authenticate
Not required. Follow instructions at [node-github](http://mikedeboer.github.io/node-github/#Client.prototype.authenticate).

##### email.fields
For config of these follow instructions at [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#e-mail-message-fields).

##### email.smtp
For config of these follow instructions at [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#setting-up-smtp).

##### email.template
An object with two [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco) templates for building the email. Plaintext is auto-generated from the HTML version.

And finally start it all up:

```bash
$ node index.js
```

There is also a service on `/` started on an automatic port or one specified through command line.

## ENV

One can use ENV variables in the config.

Replace the value in the `config.json` file with a string that begins with a `$` followed by the ENV variable path. The app will recognize that and get the value from the environment. Example:

`"$GITHUB_TOKEN"` > `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN`

## FYI

The data is stored in a flat file `EJDB` database, app reload on PaaS platforms like Heroku will probably wipe your history.
